This is a simple monthly planner program  that was created to help me in my journey in learning Korean! Every month I can choose what Korean topic I want to learn and to help me with that, I can assign a drama series and a song to listen to because that actually helps more in retaining them in one's memory! 

For this project, I used the Abstract factory  design pattern for my  creation; flyweight design pattern for it's structure; and the iterator design pattern for its behavior. 

I used the JUnit 4 for TDD.

As for the best practices, I followed the following: 
Source file has less than 2000 lines of code, includes comments for each class and block of codes that tells what happens, proper naming for classes and variables - i didn't use abbraviations and used camel case,the method names are also understandable (has verbs), indention was also consistent all throughout the code, line breaks since i leave one space after every block, and i also have declarations and assignments.
